{% include base_path %}

I have recently joined the [Oxford Molecular Motors](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/group/oxford-molecular-motors) group as a Postdoctoral Researcher.

Before then, I was a PhD student at the University of Warwick, where I worked in the Soft Matter and Biofluids group under the supervision of Dr. Vasily Kantsler. I also received my undergraduate degree from Warwick, where I graduated in 2018 with a first-class BSc (Hons) in Physics.

Prior to moving to the UK in 2015, I lived and graduated High School in (the much sunnier!) Italy, where I am originally from. When Iâ€™m not in the lab or analysing data, I like playing guitar, reading and playing football as well as drinking (potentially) unhealthy amounts of coffee.
