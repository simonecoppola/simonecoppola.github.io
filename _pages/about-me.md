I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Holden Lab](https://holdenlab.github.io/) at the University of Warwick, where my main focus is the development of image processing and microscopy tools to study how bacteria grow and divide.

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Oxford Molecular Motors](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/group/oxford-molecular-motors) group, where my main focus was studying the molecular mechanisms underpinning microbial motility. To this end, I led the group's efforts in the development of a novel, low-cost large FOV 3D single-molecule microscope, as well as developing image processing and data analysis tools.

Before then, I was a PhD student at the University of Warwick, where I worked in the Soft Matter and Biofluids group under the supervision of Dr. Vasily Kantsler. My research there was also focussed on microbial motility, with a particular focus on understanding how external stimuli affect the swimming behaviour of green algae, bacteria and spermatozoa. Through this research, I also gained expertise in designing and producing microfluidics devices for both research and bioengineering purposes.

I also received my undergraduate degree from Warwick, where I graduated in 2018 with a First-class BSc (Hons) in Physics.

Prior to moving to the UK in 2015, I lived and graduated High School in (the much sunnier!) Italy, where I am originally from. When Iâ€™m not in the lab or analysing data, I like playing guitar, reading and playing football as well as drinking (potentially) unhealthy amounts of coffee.
