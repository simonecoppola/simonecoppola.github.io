Hi! My name is Simone Coppola and I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Warwick, where I work in the [Holden Lab](https://holdenlab.github.io/).

I am interested in the molecular mechanisms underpinning microbial motility and growth and how those can be studied through the development of bespoke super-resolution optical microscopy setups and advanced image and data analysis. Feel free to have a look at the "Research" page and sub-pages to get a better feel of my research work!

I am always open to collaboration and interesting chats, so don't be afraid to get in touch!
