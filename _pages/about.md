Hi! My name is Simone Coppola and I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Oxford, where I work in the [Oxford Molecular Motors Group](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/group/oxford-molecular-motors).

I am particularly interested in the molecular mechanisms underpinning microbial motility and how those can be studied through the development of bespoke super-resolution optical microscopy setups and advanced image and data processing. Feel free to have a look at the "Research" page and sub-pages to get a better feel of my research work!

I am always open to collaboration and interesting chats, so don't be afraid to get in touch!
